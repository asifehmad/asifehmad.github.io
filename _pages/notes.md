Whenever I learn about something I try to put it into my own words in order to understand it better. Here are some random examples, feel free to have a look, but be careful of typos and more  serious mistakes and please do let me know if you find any of those!

**Expressivity of Neural Networks:** Coming soon...

**Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces:** Coming soon...


**Parameter estimation for discrete determinantal processes:**

**Random fields:**

**Measures as dual spaces:**

[**Characterisation of Hilbert spaces:**](/files/Hilbert-spaces.pdf) One can explicitely characterise Hilbert spaces and show that they are ismetrically isomorphic to $L^2$ spaces with respect to the counting measure. Using this approach one can show the representation theorem of Riesz just like in linear algebra.
