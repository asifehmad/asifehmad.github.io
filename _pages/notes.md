Often when learning something new I try to put it into my own words in order to understand it better. Here are some random examples. Feel free to have a look, however since those are not proofread treat them carefully and please let me which mistakes you find!

**Expressivity of Neural Networks:** Coming soon...

**Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces:** Coming soon...


**Parameter estimation for discrete determinantal processes:**

**Random fields:**

[**Measures as dual spaces:**](/files/measures-scr-style.pdf) Finitely additive measures naturally induce linear forms on measurable functions. Even more, they form exactly the dual space of bounded measurable functions. Further, the $sigma$ additivity of a measure is equivalent to theorems of monotone and dominated convergence.

[**Characterisation of Hilbert spaces:**](/files/Hilbert-spaces.pdf) One can explicitely characterise Hilbert spaces and show that they are ismetrically isomorphic to $L^2$ spaces with respect to the counting measure. Using this approach one can show the representation theorem of Riesz just like in linear algebra; see also [those](http://home.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de/soergel/Skripten/ANALYSIS.pdf) lecture notes by Wolfgang Soergel.
