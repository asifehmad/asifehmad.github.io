My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. In particular this includes the following topics:
* Representational capacity of neural networks
* Connections between neural networks and differential equations
* Geometry of optimal control problems, in particular structural properties of optimal policies.

**Thesis**

* During my MSc studies at the University  of Warwick I was supervised by [Nikos Zygouras](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/zygouras/) and [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas) and completed my  thesis on the parameter estimation of determinantal point processes. You can find the PDF [here](/files/MSc-thesis.pdf ). 
 
* At the University of  Freiburg, I studied the approximation capabilities of deep residual networks under the supervision of [Philipp Harms](https://www.philippharms.com/) and  the thesis is available [here](https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/151788).
