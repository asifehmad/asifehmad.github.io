I am a PhD student in mathematical machine learning at the [MPI MiS](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) where I am supported by the [IMPRS MiS](https://www.imprs-mis.mpg.de/). I am jointly supervised by [Nihat Ay](https://www.mis.mpg.de/ay/homepages/nay/) and [Guido Mont&uacute;far](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/) and am focusing on connections between deep learning and differential equations. Prior to that I received a Masters and Bachelors degree in Mathematics from the University of Freiburg as well as a Masters degree in Interdisciplinary Mathematics from the  Uiversity of Warwick.
