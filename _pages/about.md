I am a third year PhD student in mathematics at the [IMPRS MiS](https://www.imprs-mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig where I am jointly supervised by [Nihat Ay](https://www.mis.mpg.de/ay/homepages/nay/) and [Guido Mont&uacute;far](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. Before starting my PhD I received a Masters and Bachelors degree in Mathematics from the University of Freiburg as well as a Masters degree in Interdisciplinary Mathematics from the  University of Warwick. 

< Currently, I focus on geometric aspects of reward optimization in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). >
