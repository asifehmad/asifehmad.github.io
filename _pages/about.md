I am a co-founder and technical lead at [Neural Internet](https://neuralinternet.ai/), where I have been driving research and development in decentralized AI. I was key in launching the Compute Subnet on the Bittensor network and managing a team responsible for validator maintenance. Alongside my work in tech, I am a lecturer in Mathematics at Ghulam Ishaq Khan ([GIK](https://giki.edu.pk/)) Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Topi, Pakistan. My background in both industry and academia gives me a unique perspective on the intersection of AI, blockchain, and advanced computing.
