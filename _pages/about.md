I am a Postdoc in the group of Guido Mont&uacute;far at [MPI MiS](https://www.mis.mpg.de/montufar/index.html), where I focus on algorithmic regularization in deep learning. I received my PhD from [Leipzig University (Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science)](https://www.fmi.uni-leipzig.de/cms/en/startseite/), under the supervision of [J&uuml;rgen Jost](https://www.mis.mpg.de/de/jjost/juergen-jost.html). Before joining MPI, I obtained my Masters and Bachelors degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.

I work at the intersection of information theory and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in algorithmic regularization in deep learning. You can read more about my research here.
