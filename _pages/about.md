I am a PhD student in mathematical machine learning at the [IMPRS MiS](https://www.imprs-mis.mpg.de/) where I am jointly supervised by [Nihat Ay](https://www.mis.mpg.de/ay/homepages/nay/) and [Guido Mont&uacute;far](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). My research interests lies in the connection of deep learning models and applied mathematics. This ranges from the study of the representational capacity of neural networks to their connections to differential equations which are manifold. Before I starting  my PhD I received a Masters and Bachelors degree in Mathematics from the University of Freiburg as well as a Masters degree in Interdisciplinary Mathematics from the  Uiversity of Warwick.
