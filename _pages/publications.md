My research interests lie in the area of mathematical machine learning in particular in the expressivity of neural networks and the conection to differential equations. Here is a selected list of publications. See also my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=Wfww-P8AAAAJ&hl=en) profile page.

***Thesis***

During my MSc studies at the University  of Warwick I was supervised by [Nikos Zygouras](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/zygouras/) and [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas) and completed my  thesis on the parameter estimation of determinantal point processes. You can find the PDF here and a shortened version here. 
 
At the University of  Freiburg, I studied the approximation capabilities of deep residual networks under the supervision of [Philipp Harms](https://www.philippharms.com/) and  the thesis is available [here](https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/151788).
