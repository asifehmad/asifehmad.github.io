My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. This includes the study of the representational capacity of neural networks, their connection to differential equations which are manifold as well as many other exciting topics. Here is a list of publications, preprints, poster presentations and my thesis. See also my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=Wfww-P8AAAAJ&hl=en) profile page.

**Thesis**

During my MSc studies at the University  of Warwick I was supervised by [Nikos Zygouras](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/zygouras/) and [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas) and completed my  thesis on the parameter estimation of determinantal point processes. You can find the PDF [here](/files/MSc-thesis.pdf ). 
 
At the University of  Freiburg, I studied the approximation capabilities of deep residual networks under the supervision of [Philipp Harms](https://www.philippharms.com/) and  the thesis is available [here](https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/151788).
